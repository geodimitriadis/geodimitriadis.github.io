<p>I am an observational astrophysicist specialising in transient astronomy, with a particular focus on Type Ia supernovae, their progenitor systems, and the diversity of thermonuclear transients.<p>

<p>I completed my PhD in Astronomy at the University of Southampton, following an MSc in Physics and Astronomy at the Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy in Amsterdam and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.  
My research career has taken me through positions at the University of California in Santa Cruz, Trinity College Dublin, and Lancaster University, where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow.<p>

<p>My work combines large-scale transient surveys with detailed optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, with the aim of understanding the explosion physics and improving the use of Type Ia supernovae as cosmological tools.<p>
