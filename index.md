I am an observational astrophysicist specialising in transient astronomy, with a particular focus on Type Ia supernovae, their progenitor systems, and the diversity of thermonuclear transients.

I completed my PhD in Astronomy at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/astronomy-group), following an MSc in Physics and Astronomy at the [Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy](https://api.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en/home/).  
My research career has taken me through positions at the [University of California in Santa Cruz](https://transients.ucsc.edu/), [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/physics/research/groups/explosive-transients/), and [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/astrophysics/observational-astrophysics/), where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow.

My work combines large-scale transient surveys with detailed optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, with the aim of understanding the explosion physics and improving the use of Type Ia supernovae as cosmological tools.
