I’m an astronomer interested in exoplanets and stellar variability, with a focus on extracting physical signals from time-series data (photometry and spectroscopy).

I’m currently based at **[Institution]**, where I work on **[one-line project]**.

Outside research, I enjoy films/TV and following sports.
