## Selected publications

- **ZTF SN Ia DR2: The diversity and relative rates of the thermonuclear SN population**  
  *Astronomy & Astrophysics*, Volume 694, A10 (2025) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...694A..10D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Performed a large-scale statistical study of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, presenting spectroscopic classifications alongside photometric properties, host-galaxy characteristics, and subclass fractions.
  </span>

- **SN 2021zny: an early flux excess combined with late-time oxygen emission suggests a double white dwarf merger event**  
  *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, Volume 521, 1162–1183 (2023) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.1162D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Provided strong observational evidence that the 03fg-like SN 2021zny originated from a double white-dwarf merger, based on a short-lived blue flash shortly after explosion and late-time oxygen emission.
  </span>

- **A Carbon/Oxygen-dominated Atmosphere Days after Explosion for the "Super-Chandrasekhar" Type Ia SN 2020esm**  
  *The Astrophysical Journal*, Volume 927, 78 (2022) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...78D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Showed that the 03fg-like SN 2020esm exhibited a nearly pure carbon–oxygen atmosphere during the first days after explosion, consistent with the merger of two carbon–oxygen white dwarfs.
  </span>

- **Nebular Spectroscopy of Kepler's Brightest Supernova**  
  *The Astrophysical Journal Letters*, Volume 870, L14 (2019) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870L..14D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Estimated stringent upper limits on the amount of hydrogen and helium stripped from a companion star by the explosion of SN 2018oh, an event exhibiting a prominent early flux excess.
  </span>

- **K2 Observations of SN 2018oh Reveal a Two-component Rising Light Curve for a Type Ia Supernova**  
  *The Astrophysical Journal Letters*, Volume 870, L1 (2019) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870L...1D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Presented a high-cadence (30-min) light curve with the earliest detection (3.6 h after explosion) of a blue flux excess, as predicted by some SN Ia progenitor scenarios.
  </span>

- **The late-time light curve of the Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe**  
  *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, Volume 468, 3798–3812 (2017) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.3798D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Analysed extremely late-time observations of the well-studied SN Ia 2011fe, demonstrating the presence of radioactive <sup>57</sup>Ni and constraining its progenitor system.
  </span>

- **Early X-ray emission from Type Ia supernovae originating from symbiotic progenitors or recurrent novae**  
  *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, Volume 443, 1370–1380 (2014) —
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.443.1370D/abstract"
     target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADS</a>  
  <span style="color:#666;">
    Explained the absence of X-ray emission in SNe Ia using numerical hydrodynamical simulations of recurrent nova eruptions prior to the terminal supernova explosion and the subsequent interaction with the surrounding medium.
