Our ZTF SNe Ia cosmology working group performed an analysis of ZTF SN Ia DR2, the SNe Ia discovered by <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZTF</a> from 2018 to 2020, the largest low-redshift sample of SNe Ia of all flavors, a work that resulted in a <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/toc/?task=topic&id=2090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Issue</a> at Astronomy & Astrophysics. I led the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...694A..10D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> of their observed properties and their relative rates, combining photometric, spectroscopic and host galaxy information to map the diversity of the thermonuclear supernova population.

A long-standing puzzle in the study of thermonuclear supernovae is the existence of so-called *Super-Chandrasekhar* Type Ia supernovae, whose extreme luminosities imply ejecta masses that exceed the canonical Chandrasekhar limit for a non-rotating white dwarf. These events are characterised by unusually slow light-curve evolution, high peak luminosities, and strong carbon signatures in their early-time spectra, challenging standard explosion models. Through detailed photometric and spectroscopic analyses of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...78D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2020esm</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.1162D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2021zny</a>, we proposed that events are mergers of two carbon oxygen white dwarfs, with additional studies with JWST of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...960...88S/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2022pul</a> confirming our results.

Thanks to the Kepler Space Telescope’s K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment, one of the telescope’s final missions before it ran out of fuel, we were fortunate to observe *SN 2018oh* in exceptional detail, combining extremely high-cadence <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870L...1D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kepler observations</a> with dedicated <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870...12L/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ground-based follow-up campaigns</a>. SN 2018oh exhibited a small bump in its light curve during the first ~5 days after explosion — an early flux excess superimposed on the radioactively powered luminosity typical of normal Type Ia supernovae. Interpretations of this behaviour range from the interaction of the supernova ejecta with a non-degenerate companion star to the detonation of a helium shell on the surface of the exploding white dwarf prior to the main explosion. Today, a variety of early light-curve bumps are <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1317D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely observed</a> in Type Ia supernovae, highlighting the growing diversity of thermonuclear explosion pathways.

## Surveys & collaborations

### Vera C. Rubin / Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (<a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/explore/how-rubin-works/lsst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSST</a>) of the <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> will usher in a new era of time-domain astronomy by repeatedly imaging the southern sky with unprecedented depth, cadence, and uniformity. By discovering and monitoring millions of supernovae and other transients over a wide range of timescales and redshifts, LSST will open vast new discovery space for rare, extreme, and previously unknown classes of variable phenomena. Its scale and homogeneity will enable population-level studies that move beyond individual events, allowing systematic mapping of the diversity and evolution of stellar explosions, accretion-driven transients, and variable sources across cosmic history. In parallel, the cosmological exploitation of LSST data is being led by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (<a href="https://lsstdesc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DESC</a>), which will deliver precision measurements of cosmic expansion and structure growth, providing transformative constraints on dark energy and fundamental physics.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (<a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZTF</a>) has reshaped time-domain astronomy by providing high-cadence, wide-field optical monitoring of the northern sky and unprecedented access to the dynamic Universe. Its ability to discover large numbers of transients shortly after explosion has enabled transformative studies of the earliest phases of supernovae, revealed the prevalence of early-time light-curve excesses, and uncovered new classes of rare and fast-evolving transients. Beyond stellar explosions, ZTF has dramatically expanded samples of tidal disruption events, changing-look active galactic nuclei, and electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave sources, linking optical variability to compact-object physics and black-hole accretion. At the same time, ZTF is delivering the most comprehensive and well-controlled low-redshift Type Ia supernova sample to date, providing a critical foundation for precision cosmology and anchoring distance measurements used by higher-redshift surveys.
