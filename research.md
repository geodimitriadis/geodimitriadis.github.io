I study fast-evolving optical transients discovered in wide-field time-domain
surveys, focusing on their photometric and spectroscopic diversity and the
physical mechanisms powering their emission.

Thanks to the Kepler Space Telescope’s K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment, one of the telescope’s final missions before it ran out of fuel, we were fortunate to observe SN 2018oh in exceptional detail, combining extremely high-cadence [Kepler observations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870L...1D/abstract) with dedicated [ground-based follow-up campaigns](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870...12L/abstract). SN 2018oh exhibited a small bump in its light curve during the first ~5 days after explosion—an early flux excess superimposed on the radioactively powered luminosity typical of normal Type Ia supernovae. Interpretations of this behaviour range from the interaction of the supernova ejecta with a non-degenerate companion star to the detonation of a helium shell on the surface of the exploding white dwarf prior to the main explosion. Today, a variety of early light-curve bumps are [routinely observed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1317D/abstract) in Type Ia supernovae, highlighting the growing diversity of thermonuclear explosion pathways.

I am involved in the analysis and follow-up of transient alerts from ZTF,
with an emphasis on rapidly evolving and unusual events.
