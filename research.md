Our ZTF SNe Ia cosmology working group performed an analysis of ZTF SN Ia DR2, the SNe Ia discovered by <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZTF</a> from 2018 to 2020, the largest low-redshift sample of SNe Ia of all flavors, a work that resulted in a <a href="https://www.aanda.org/component/toc/?task=topic&id=2090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Issue</a> at Astronomy & Astrophysics. I led the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...694A..10D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> of their observed properties and their relative rates, combining photometric, spectroscopic and host galaxy information to map the diversity of the thermonuclear supernova population.

A long-standing puzzle in the study of thermonuclear supernovae is the existence of so-called *Super-Chandrasekhar* Type Ia supernovae, whose extreme luminosities imply ejecta masses that exceed the canonical Chandrasekhar limit for a non-rotating white dwarf. These events are characterised by unusually slow light-curve evolution, high peak luminosities, and strong carbon signatures in their early-time spectra, challenging standard explosion models. Through detailed photometric and spectroscopic analyses of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...78D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2020esm</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.1162D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2021zny</a>, we proposed that events are mergers of two carbon oxygen white dwarfs, with additional studies with JWST of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...960...88S/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SN 2022pul</a> confirming our results.

Thanks to the Kepler Space Telescope’s K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment, one of the telescope’s final missions before it ran out of fuel, we were fortunate to observe *SN 2018oh* in exceptional detail, combining extremely high-cadence <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870L...1D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kepler observations</a> with dedicated <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870...12L/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ground-based follow-up campaigns</a>. SN 2018oh exhibited a small bump in its light curve during the first ~5 days after explosion — an early flux excess superimposed on the radioactively powered luminosity typical of normal Type Ia supernovae. Interpretations of this behaviour range from the interaction of the supernova ejecta with a non-degenerate companion star to the detonation of a helium shell on the surface of the exploding white dwarf prior to the main explosion. Today, a variety of early light-curve bumps are <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1317D/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely observed</a> in Type Ia supernovae, highlighting the growing diversity of thermonuclear explosion pathways.

I am involved in the analysis and follow-up of transient alerts from ZTF,
with an emphasis on rapidly evolving and unusual events.
